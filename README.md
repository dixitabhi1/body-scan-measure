# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info
This project presents a complete, end-to-end solution for estimating approximate human body measurements from a set of three standard pose images (front, side, and standing full-body). Developed for the Voms Tech Machine Round, this system demonstrates a robust, explainable, and deployable AI/ML pipeline that meets all mandatory output and submission requirements.

The core of the solution is a hybrid approach combining state-of-the-art computer vision for pose estimation with a machine learning regression model for robust measurement prediction.
